    <h1>A Monthly Cycle</h1>
    <p>Aunt Flo, the crimson wave, shark week, and that time of the month.</p>
    <p>Menstruation.</p>
    <p>Rarely referred to by name—more commonly by euphemism—periods are clouded
      by a cultural taboo and often misunderstood even by the women who
      experience them monthly.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="timeline-nav"></div>
  <div id="menstruation-start">
    <h2>Menstruation</h2>
    <p>The entire system is regulated by a group of hormones. The brain tells
      the pituitary gland to produce two hormones specifically called
      ollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).</p>
    <p>On day one—otherwise known as the first day of the period and the start
      of the “Follicular Phase”—FSH is rising a little and LH is still low. FSH
      travels to the ovaries through the bloodstream.</p>
  <div id="follicular-phase">
    <h2>Follicular Phase</h2>
    <p>The ovaries are filled with hundreds of thousands of follicles containing
       eggs. When FSH arrives at the ovary it stimulates the growth of many
       follicles, but only one will release an egg. As these follicles grow,
       they release another hormone called estrogen. During the follicular
       phase, estrogen will be the main player. </p>
    <p>In these early stages, while estrogen is low it has a suppressive effect
      on LH which is why is remains low throughout the follicular phase. As
      estrogen rises it also tells the brain to decrease the production of FSH.
      And estrogen will continue to rise. And rise. And rise….</p>
    <p>As estrogen rises, the walls of the uterus will also begin to thicken.
      The thickened uterine walls contain nutrients for which will contribute to
      maintaining a healthy pregnancy in the event that the egg is fertilized.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="ovulation">
    <h2>Ovulation</h2>
    <p>Eventually, estrogen will reach peak levels. Once it is sufficiently
      high, it triggers a surge in production of LH and a slight bump in FSH.
      The two together travel to the ovaries and trigger the release of the egg
      from the matured most dominant follicle. This is known as ovulation.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="luteal-phase">
    <h2>Luteal Phase</h2>
    <p>Ovulation marks a shift in the cycle. The egg leaves the ovary to enter
      the uterus. The ruptured follicle is left behind and becomes the corpus
      luteum. This begins the second phase of the cycle: the luteal phase. </p>
    <p>The corpus luteum has a dominant role in the luteal phase as it will
      produce progesterone—the key hormone in the second half of the cycle.
      Progesterone will help maintain the thickened uterine wall. </p>
    <p>The corpus luteum will also contribute to a second rise in estrogen
      levels and also tell the brain to limit production of FSH and LH. </p>
    <p>If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will slowly die off.
      It will stop producing progesterone and estrogen and the levels of both
      will fall. </p>
  </div>
  <div id="menstruation-end">
    <h2>Menstruation</h2>
    <p>Without estrogen and progesterone, the uterine wall is no longer
      supported, and it will deteriorate. The blood and nutrients will break
      off and exit the uterus, beginning day one of the cycle and the period.
