            month.</p>
          <p>Menstruation.</p>
          <p>Rarely referred to by name—more commonly by euphemism—periods are
            clouded by a cultural taboo and often misunderstood even by the
            women who experience them monthly.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <h2>Menstruation</h2>
          <p>The entire system is regulated by a group of hormones. The brain
            tells the pituitary gland to produce two hormones specifically called
            ollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).</p>
          <p>On day one—otherwise known as the first day of the period and the
            start of the “Follicular Phase”—FSH is rising a little and LH is
            still low. FSH travels to the ovaries through the bloodstream.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="follicular-phase" class="panel follicular-phase">
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Follicular Phase</h2>
          <p>The ovaries are filled with hundreds of thousands of follicles
            containing eggs. When FSH arrives at the ovary it stimulates the
            growth of many follicles, but only one will release an egg. As
            these follicles grow, they release another hormone called estrogen.
            During the follicular phase, estrogen will be the main player. </p>
          <p>In these early stages, while estrogen is low it has a suppressive
            effect on LH which is why is remains low throughout the follicular
            phase. As estrogen rises it also tells the brain to decrease the
            production of FSH. And estrogen will continue to rise. And rise.
            And rise….</p>
          <p>As estrogen rises, the walls of the uterus will also begin to
            thicken. The thickened uterine walls contain nutrients for which
            will contribute to maintaining a healthy pregnancy in the event
            that the egg is fertilized.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="ovulation" class="panel ovulation">
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Ovulation</h2>
          <p>Eventually, estrogen will reach peak levels. Once it is sufficiently
            high, it triggers a surge in production of LH and a slight bump in FSH.
            The two together travel to the ovaries and trigger the release of the egg
            from the matured most dominant follicle. This is known as ovulation.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="luteal-phase" class="panel luteal-phase">
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Luteal Phase</h2>
          <p>Ovulation marks a shift in the cycle. The egg leaves the ovary to
            enter the uterus. The ruptured follicle is left behind and becomes
            the corpus luteum. This begins the second phase of the cycle: the
            luteal phase. </p>
          <p>The corpus luteum has a dominant role in the luteal phase as it
            will produce progesterone—the key hormone in the second half of the
            cycle. Progesterone will help maintain the thickened uterine
            wall. </p>
          <p>The corpus luteum will also contribute to a second rise in
            estrogen levels and also tell the brain to limit production of FSH
            and LH. </p>
          <p>If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum will slowly die
            off. It will stop producing progesterone and estrogen and the
            levels of both will fall. </p>

      <section id="menstruation-end" class="panel menstruation-end">
        <div class="text">
          <h2>Menstruation</h2>
          <p>Without estrogen and progesterone, the uterine wall is no longer
            supported, and it will deteriorate. The blood and nutrients will
            break off and exit the uterus, beginning day one of the cycle and
            the period.</p>
